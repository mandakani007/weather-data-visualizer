This project is part of my “Programming for Problem Solving using Python” course.  
The aim is to load a weather dataset, clean it, analyze it, and visualize the results.

## Tasks Completed
- Loaded raw weather data (CSV)
- Cleaned the dataset (handled missing values)
- Converted date column to datetime format
- Calculated daily and monthly statistics using NumPy and Pandas
- Created visualizations:
  - Daily temperature line chart
  - Monthly rainfall bar chart
  - Humidity vs temperature scatter plot
  - Combined subplot figure
- Grouped data by months and seasons
- Exported cleaned data and summaries

- `weather_data_raw.csv` → Raw dataset
- `cleaned_weather_data.csv` → Cleaned dataset
- `images/` → Folder containing plot images
- `Summary_Report.md` → Written summary of insights

## Tools Used
